This notebook presents three key NLP tasks.  

**Q1** focuses on sentiment classification of IMDB movie reviews using both ANN and CNN models, achieving over 88% accuracy with ANN.   

**Q2** explores Word Embeddings using GloVe to visualize semantic groupings via PCA and t-SNE, revealing meaningful clusters in 3D space.  

**Q3** applies Word2Vec for news topic classification (AG News) with Random Forest, achieving ~89% accuracy, outperforming TF-IDF baselines. 

The workflow highlights preprocessing, vectorization, modeling, and evaluationâ€”offering a practical understanding of deep learning and embeddings in NLP pipelines.
